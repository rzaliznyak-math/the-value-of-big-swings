## Introduction

Dear Prospective App User, 

Our [**Alphabeta Testing App (in/alphabeta)**](https://de.dash.a.intuit.com/alphabeta){target="_blank"} allows you to end AB tests in less than half the time of a significance test. We achieve this speed by analyzing results daily with Bayesian AB Tests.

If anything in this wiki is unclear or outdated, we’d appreciate direct comments in our slack channel [**#ab-testing-and-causal-inference [slack]**](https://intuit-teams.slack.com/archives/C05BN8CSSHH){target="_blank"}.

Sincerely,<br>
Russ Zaliznyak & Joe Powers
